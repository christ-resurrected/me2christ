And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement *Hebrews 9:27*

But the **cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, ☠️murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters**, and **all liars** shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. *Revelation 21:8*

Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. *1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:9-10*

Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, [heresies](heresies.html), envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will **not** inherit the kingdom of God. *Galatians 5:19-21*

For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. *Ephesians 5:5*
