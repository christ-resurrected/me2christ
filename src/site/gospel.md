# THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST

## THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND AND JESUS IS LORD

The kingdom of God was opened to us when Jesus came. He is the King, the Son of God, the Savior, and the One who will judge the world. Jesus is the One we must obey if we want to be a part of the kingdom we were created for. Jesus will literally return one day and fully bring in His eternal reign once and for all on a new earth.

From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” -Matthew 4:17

“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.” -Matthew 7:21

“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” -John 14:6

## JESUS DIED AND ROSE FROM THE GRAVE

Jesus was crucified, but God raised Him from the dead, proving that Jesus is the Son of God. He gave His life as a ransom to free us from our selfish ways and turn us back to God. He suffered, died, and rose again so that we would listen to Him now and be changed into people who love God and do His will. After His resurrection, Jesus ascended to heaven where He is now seated in power at God’s right hand.

“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” -Mark 10:45

He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
-1 Peter 2:24

[God] raised Him [Jesus] from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places
-Ephesians 1:20

## FORGIVENESS AND NEW LIFE OFFERED TO ALL WHO BELIEVE IN JESUS

All who trust in Jesus and submit to His authority are forgiven by God. They are released from captivity to sin and receive the Holy Spirit to give them power for a new life. This is a gift of God’s grace (kindness/favor), but is not something we can abuse. Scripture urges Christians to remain in the grace of God and warns them not to receive His grace in vain.

“To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” -Acts 10:43

“Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” -Acts 2:38

Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. -Romans 6:4

See also: Jn 1:16-17, Acts 13:38-39, Rom 1:5, 1 Cor 15:9-10, Eph 2:8-10, 1 Tim 1:12-17, Tit 2:11-14, Jude 1:4. More on grace - Matt 18:21-35, Acts 13:43, Rom 6:15, Rom 11:22, 2 Cor 6:1, Heb 10:26-30

## JESUS WILL RETURN TO JUDGE THE WORLD

Jesus will come back to give to us all according to what we did. Those who follow Jesus and do the will of His Father will be welcomed into His eternal kingdom. But those who continue to do evil will face God’s punishment.

“For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself, and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man. Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.”
-John 5:26-29

“Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.” -Acts 17:30-31

For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. -2 Corinthians 5:10-11

See also: Matt 16:27, Matt 25:14-46, Acts 3:19-23, Acts 24:24-25, Rom 2:5-11, 1 Cor 6:9-11, Gal 5:19-21, Eph 5:1-8, Ja 5:7-9, Rev 20:11-14, Rev 21:6-8

## HOW DO WE NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE?

Jesus said, “He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.”
-Matt 10:37-39

Being a Christian means a full surrender of your whole life to Jesus as your new King. If you are ready for that commitment, you must repent and be baptized in His name. Then you must learn to obey all He taught and commanded, following Him to the end. God will help you if you are willing and obedient.

“If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” -John 7:38

“He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.” -John 14:21

Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. -1 John 2:3-6
