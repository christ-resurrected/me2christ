# THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST

## THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND AND JESUS IS LORD

The kingdom of God was opened to us when Jesus came. He is the King, the Son of God, the Savior, and the One who will judge the world. Jesus is the One we must obey if we want to be a part of the kingdom we were created for. Jesus will literally return one day and fully bring in His eternal reign once and for all on a new earth.
