      :markdown-it
        The word "gospel" is translated from the Greek word εὐαγγέλιον which means "good news" or "glad tidings".
        Jesus commands His followers to go out into the world and preach this good news...

      .verses
        +verse('Mark 16:15,16')
          | And He said to them, #[q.Jesus Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.]
        +verse('Mat.10:7-8')
          q.Jesus And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.

      p To help with this endeavour, I have created these gospel tracts to hand out.
      p You can find the PDFs and source code #[a(href=SOURCE_URL) here].
