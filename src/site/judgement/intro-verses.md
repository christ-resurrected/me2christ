Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: **adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, [heresies](heresies.html), envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like**; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will **not** inherit the kingdom of God. *Gal.&nbsp;5:19-21*

For this you know, that no **fornicator, unclean person**, nor **covetous** man, who is an **idolater**, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. *Eph.&nbsp;5:5*
