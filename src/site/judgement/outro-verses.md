And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement *Heb.&nbsp;9:27*

But the **cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters**, and **all liars** shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. *Rev.&nbsp;21:8*

Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither **fornicators**, nor **idolaters**, nor **adulterers**, nor **homosexuals**, nor **sodomites**, nor **thieves**, nor **covetous**, nor **drunkards**, nor **revilers**, nor **extortioners** will inherit the kingdom of God. *1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;6:9-10*

For this you know, that no **fornicator, unclean person**, nor **covetous** man, who is an **idolater**, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. *Eph.&nbsp;5:5*
