    h2 THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND AND JESUS IS LORD

    | The kingdom of God was opened to us when Jesus came. He is King of kings and Lord of lords, the Son of God, the Saviour, and the One who will judge the world. Jesus is the One we #[em must obey] if we want to be a part of the eternal kingdom we were created for.

    +verse('John 1:1,14')(seeAlso='Mat.3:17, 28:18; Luke 1:32,33; John 14:6; Acts 2:36, 4:12, 9:20, 10:42; Rom.1:1-4; Col.1:15-18; 1-Tim.6:15,16; Heb.1:1-4; Rev.1:5,17,18')
      | In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

    +verse('Matt. 4:17')(seeAlso='Mat.7:21, 24:14; Mark 1:14,15; Luke 4:43, 6:20; Rom.14:17; Col.1:13; Heb.12:28; 2-Pet.1:5-11')

    h2 JESUS DIED AND ROSE FROM THE GRAVE

    | Jesus was crucified but God raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand, proving Jesus is the Son of God. Jesus gave His life as a ransom, to open our eyes, to turn us back to God, to free us from our selfish ways. This He suffered, hoping we would listen to Him and be changed into people who #[em love] God, #[em practice righteousness] and #[em do] His will.

    h2 FORGIVENESS AND NEW LIFE OFFERED TO ALL WHO BELIEVE

    | All who trust in Jesus and #[em humbly submit] to His authority are forgiven by God. They are released from captivity to sin and receive the Holy Spirit to give them power for a new supernatural life. This is a gift of God’s grace (kindness/favor), but is not something we can abuse. Scripture urges Christians to remain in the grace of God and warns them not to receive His grace in vain.

    +verse('Rom. 6:4')(seeAlso='Rom.6; 2-Cor.5:17; Col.1:13,14')
      | Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

  h2 HOW MUST WE RESPOND TO THIS GOOD NEWS?

  :markdown-it
    Being a Christian means a *full surrender* of your whole life to Jesus as your Lord and King. If you are ready for that commitment, you must *repent* and be baptized in His name. Then you must learn to *obey* all He taught and commanded, take up your cross, and follow Him to the very end. God will help you if you are *willing* and *obedient*.

  +verse('Acts 2:38')(seeAlso='Acts 3:19; John 7:38; Mat.28:19-20')
    q Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

  +verse('John 14:21')(seeAlso='1-John 3:3-10')
    q.Jesus He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.

  +verse('Mat. 10:37-39')(seeAlso='Mat.24:13; Mark 8:34-38; Luke 9:23-25, 13:24, 14:26-33; John 12:23-26, 15:1-10; Acts 14:22; 1-Cor.9:24-10:13; Php.3:12-14; Heb 12:1-3; 2-Pet.1:3-11; Rev.2:26')
    | He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.

  +verse('1-John 2:3-6')
    | Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
