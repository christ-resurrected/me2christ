      +verse('2-Pet.2:1')(seeAlso='Acts 20:29-31'): :markdown-it But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be *false teachers* among you, who will secretly bring in *destructive heresies*, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.
      +verse('Jude 1:3')(seeAlso='Jude 1:4; Eph.5:11'): :markdown-it Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.
      +verse('2-Tim.4:3-4'): :markdown-it For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their *own desires*, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be *turned aside to fables*.
