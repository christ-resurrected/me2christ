          To repent means to recognise your sin, accept God's forgiveness,
          then turn away from doing and thinking those things.

    +modal('sin')
      :markdown-it
        Sin is when we ignore God, break his laws, and go our own way in life.

        Sin destroys relationships with friends, family, and with God.

        The bible says sin ultimately brings death.
