      Jesus was and is the Son of God who died on a cross to take our sins away,
      was buried, then resurrected three days later,
      then ascended into eternal life in heaven.

  +modal('sin')
    :markdown-it
      Sin is when we think, say or do wrong things, ignore God
      and break his laws.

      Sadly, sin hurts ourselves and those around us,
      separates us from God's love, and ultimately brings death.
